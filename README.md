# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

## üìö Description

This project focuses on understanding the shell environment, initialization files, shell variables (local and global), shell arithmetic, expansions, aliases, and executing scripts in the current shell context. It is a fundamental part of learning how Bash works under the hood.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `0-alias` | Creates an alias named `ls` with value `rm *` |
| `1-hello_you` | Prints "hello `<user>`", where `<user>` is the current Linux username |
| `2-path` | Adds `/action` to the end of the `PATH` environment variable |
| `3-paths` | Counts the number of directories in the current `$PATH` |
| `4-global_variables` | Lists all global (environment) variables |
| `5-local_variables` | Lists all local variables, environment variables, and shell functions |
| `6-create_local_variable` | Creates a local variable named `BEST` with the value `School` |
| `7-create_global_variable` | Creates a global variable named `BEST` with the value `School` |
| `8-true_knowledge` | Adds `128` to the value stored in `$TRUEKNOWLEDGE` and prints the result |
| `9-divide_and_rule` | Divides the value of `$POWER` by `$DIVIDE` and prints the result |
| `10-love_exponent_breath` | Raises the value of `$BREATH` to the power of `$LOVE` |
| `11-binary_to_decimal` | Converts the binary number stored in `$BINARY` to decimal |
| `12-combinations` | Prints all 2-letter combinations of lowercase letters (except `oo`) |
| `13-print_float` | Prints the value of `$NUM` rounded to two decimal places |
| `100-decimal_to_hexadecimal` | Converts a number from base 10 to base 16. The decimal number is stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL`. The output is the corresponding hexadecimal representation. |
| `101-rot13` | Encodes or decodes input text using the **ROT13 encryption algorithm**. It processes standard input and assumes ASCII text. |
| `102-odd` | Prints **every other line** from the standard input, starting with the first line (i.e., filters and prints only odd-numbered lines). |
| `103-water_and_stir` | Adds two numbers stored in environment variables `WATER` and `STIR`, which are written in custom base strings `"water"` and `"stir"` respectively. The result is output in the base `"bestchol"`. A fun exercise in custom base arithmetic and string-based encoding. |
